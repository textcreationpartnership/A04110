            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:20958:8"/> when the flame is greateſt. Wherefore our Lord and bleſſed Sauior Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, who amongſt thoſe three kinds of deſired good things, the <note n="k" place="margin">Math. 6, 33.</note> eternall, which is the kingdome of heauen, the internall, which is the righteouſneſſe therof, and the externall, which are the things of this life, would haue the firſt to be moſt affected; when hee found it indaungered in his beloued Apoſtle, by his vaine curioſitie in things of no moment, ſharply encountreth him with this preſent checke, <hi>Quid id ad te?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Any farre fetcht coherence ſhal not neede for this ſcripture, being an euen tenour of a continued hiſtorie, recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a dialogue betwixte Chriſt and Saint <hi>Peter;</hi> in which when our ſauiour had bidden <hi>Peter</hi> to follow him, hee protracting his obedience, and buſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelfe otherwiſe, fell a queſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with Chriſt, what ſeruice it would pleaſe him to command Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> the beloued diſciple, which queſtion as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable for the time, and imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
<pb facs="tcp:20958:9"/> to the purpoſe, our Sauiour re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooueth as beeing too curious, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling <hi>Peter</hi> that concerneth him not. <hi>Quid id ad te?</hi> In which ſhort but ſharp reproofe that Chriſt frameth agaynſt <hi>Peter,</hi> wee may naturallie for the text, and profitablie for this age, obſerue theſe foure particulars: Firſt the agent in this text, the perſon that ſpeaketh it: and that is a ſoueraigne Lorde, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunding dutie, and anſwered for the time, not with obedience but with que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions. For if ye looke backe ye ſhal find in the firſt worde of this verſe, that it is Ieſus that ſpeaketh this, euen the ſame which ſaid, Follow me, in the 19. verſe. The ſeconde is the action, what this agent dooth, and that is a ſharpe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe of Curioſitie; in which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour contenteth not him ſelfe to ſay to Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> as he did to all the apoſtles; but with more vehemencie repels his queſtion. For when <note n="l" place="margin">Act. 1, 7</note> they asked him being at Ieruſalem, <hi>Lord wilt thou at this time reſtore the kingdome vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb facs="tcp:20958:9"/> Iſrael,</hi> hee anſwered, it concerneth you not, this is not for you to know, ſpeaking definitiuely without interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation: but here when S. <hi>Peter</hi> maketh his needles motion, our ſauiour ſpeaks earneſtly with a ſharpe reprehenſion, ſaying not, this is nothing to thee, but what is this to thee Peter, <hi>Quid hoc ad te?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third thing is the ſubiect of this reproofe, in which Peter to Chriſt had bewrayed his curioſity: and if we looke as narrowly to his fact for the faults, as <note n="m" place="margin">

The firſt for his knowledge, the ſecond for his care, and the third for his action. The firſt braunch of this ſinne is his inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate deſire, to knowe more then that which god would reueale him; for ſom things there be <note n="n" place="margin">
                  <hi>Act.</hi> 1. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:20958:10"/> and therefore our ſauiour ſaith <hi>If I wil that he tarry, what is that to thee?</hi> The ſecond branch is his care in things of no moment, neglecting in the mean ſeaſon dewties of importance: for what were the actions or pasſions of S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> his going to the graue in peace or from the croſſe, if it be compared with that obedience which the apoſtle did owe to our ſauiour Chriſt Ieſus? So that his maiſter might well ſaie, <hi>Quid id?</hi> what is that circumſtance of Iohns death to this ſubſtance of thy dewtie, that need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les queſtion to this neceſsarie office? <hi>Quid id ad te?</hi> what ſtandeſt thou about trifles, when I commande thee great things? The third branch is his buſines in other mens affaires, forgetting the dutie that appertaineth himſelfe: for he inquireth not of himſelfe, but asketh of Iohn; and therefore our ſauiour ſaith not, <hi>Quid ad rem,</hi> what is that to the purpoſe? but <hi>quid ad te?</hi> this is an other mans cauſe Peter, if it muſt needes bee that this queſtion muſt bee anſwered
<pb facs="tcp:20958:10"/> to ſome, it were more fitte that Iohn ſhould demaund it, but as for thee Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter what doeſt thou medling? <hi>Quid ad te?</hi> This concerneth not thee <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And theſe are the three parts of S. Peters curioſity, which may not vnapt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie bee <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> better diſtinguiſhed by thoſe three words which the Grecians vſe to intitle this ſinne by.

               </gap> a bootles loſt labour, and this may well agree to the firſt part of S. Peters faulte in ſearching out Gods will which hee had not reucaled, in which his attempt is therefore fruſtrate. Sometimes they call this ſin <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> a needles labour or paines beſides the matter, and ſo (God wottes) was S. Peters curioſitie, whileſt he intended ſmall things omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting greater. Another name they haue when they call it <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> the buſie bodies faulte, the medlers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie. And this muſt needs agree to ſaint Peters treſpaſſe when queſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb facs="tcp:20958:11"/> of ſaint Iohn, hee forgotte him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. Theſe therefore are the ſubiect in which the faulte was committed.</p>
            <p>The fourth and laſt thing is the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect of this action, the perſon on whom Chriſt faſteneth this rebuke; and that was ſaint Peters, one that alway before was ſparing in his queſtion, that feared to demand ought when others preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to ask; yet him Chriſt reprooueth with his <hi>Quid ad te?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of theſe fowre parcels of this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, the agente, the action, the obiecte and the ſubiecte, in order as they lye, and in meaſure for the time. And firſt for the agent.</p>
            <p>The partie which vttereth this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merited reproofe, is no meaner then Gods ſonne the worlds ſauiour Chriſt Ieſus, <note n="o" place="margin">Math. 4, 19. 20.</note> who taking Peter from the nettes a poore fiſher in the ſea, to make him in the Church a fiſher for mens ſoules, <note n="p" place="margin">Mat. 16, 17.</note> had inſtructed him from heauen with his fathers ſecrets, and had <note n="q" place="margin">Iohn 21, 7</note> mightilie confirmed him in
<pb facs="tcp:20958:11"/> the faith which hee had giuen him, by working in his ſight ſtrange ſignes and wonders. Of him therefore as a <note n="r" place="margin">Iohn 15. 5.</note> grafte of his fathers planting, which hee had <note n="ſ" place="margin">Luk. 13. 9</note> hedged in, digged rounde, and trimmed with ſuch induſtrie I ſay (not hee <note n="t" place="margin">Eſay 5, 2</note> expected grapes and gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red bitter cluſters) but <note n="u" place="margin">Mar. 11 13</note> hee looked for pleaſante fruite, and (alas) founde nought but leaues on it.</p>
            <p>For after thoſe <note n="x" place="margin">Mat. 3, 17 &amp; Matt 4. 18</note> three yeares of Peters following Chriſt, from his bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme in Iordan, to his <note n="y" place="margin">Ioh. 18, 15</note> paſſion at Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, our ſauiour would now trye howe his ſcholler had profited, what progreſſe he had made in his maiſters ſchoole, if hee had taken out his leſſon from knowledge to obedience, and therefore in this place he ſalutes S. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <note n="z" place="margin">Matt. 11, 15</note> not with <hi>Qui aures habet audiat &amp;c.</hi> Peter if thou haſt eares liſten well vnto me, I <note n="a" place="margin">Mar. 9, 5</note> am the <hi>Rabbi</hi> of the Iews, and the <note n="b" place="margin">Luk. 2, 32</note> doctour of the gentils; but <note n="c" place="margin">Mar. 8, 33</note>

            <p>And how proued Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> was he cunning in his leſſon? When his maſter called him did hee ſtraight way followe him? No (God knoweth) a raw ſchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, not readie yet in this poynte: hee yeeldeth not due obedience, but firſt pawſeth, and then queſtioneth. Firſt he pawſeth for a while, and looketh backe amongſt his fellowes, before he ſetteth one foote forth to follow Chriſt on forward.</p>
            <p>And why ſo S. <hi>Peter?</hi> kneweſt thou not the daunger, <note n="d" place="margin">Gene. 19, 26</note> for <hi>Lots</hi> lingring wife if ſhee turne but backe to Sodom, or <note n="e" place="margin">Luk. 9, 62</note> for him that looketh homewarde, if his hand be at the plough once, how the one was turned into a ſenſeleſſe pillar of ſalte, and the other prooued vnfitte to bee one of Gods kingdome? Feareſt thou not the ſame Lord, whoſe armorie is ſtill ſtored with dreadfull ordinance to execute his vengeaunce,

But was this true in Peter? had hee ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination? Yea it is too apparant, Chriſt hath detected his infirmitie.

            <p>And well woorthie of reproofe was this diſordered appetite of ſeeking wiſedome without due obedience, which Chriſt founde in Saint <hi>Peter</hi> his bleſſed Apoſtle. For there is nothing in the worlde which may bee tearmed good, but the Philoſophers haue <note n="z" place="margin">Cic. de offic. lib. 2</note> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed it in thoſe three woordes, <hi>hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtum, vtile &amp; iucundum,</hi> the pleaſurable, the profitable, and the honourable good: nor there is none of theſe three, but they are concurrent in that true wiſedome which breedeth immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.

<pb facs="tcp:20958:17"/> the pleaſing good, the delightfull: ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that in her workes are infinite riches, and I know you will all ſay, that thoſe are goods profitable: and in the laſt place, that in her exerciſe, there is endleſſe glorie; and, then that (I pray you) what is more honeſt or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable? But though theſe be inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to that true ſubſtantial wiſdome, which conſiſts <note n="b" place="margin">Deut. 4. 6.</note> not in receiuing, but keeping the ordinances of Iehouah, that it is both pleaſant (for <note n="c" place="margin">Eccl. 23. 27.</note> nothing is more ſweete then to take heed to Gods teſtimonies) and wondrous profitable, (for <note n="d" place="margin">1. <hi>Tim. 6. 6.</hi>

And if this be true in all the ſoules of men, that no created eſſence can giue them full content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it may worthily bee admired in <hi>S. Peter</hi> the Apoſtle, what ſhould make the cogitations of his minde ſo reſtleſſe, as when not <note n="c" place="margin">Mat. 16. 17.</note> fleſh and bloud, but God himſelfe from heauen, had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed vnto him the perfect truth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Ieſus Christ:</hi> (whoſe two com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleate natures are thoſe <note n="d" place="margin">Act. 9. 20.</note>

            <p>Doubtleſſe his curioſitie which hee bewrayed in this Chapter, in queſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>S. Iohn,</hi> that beloued Diſciple, treſpaſsing in the meane while, by a ſin of omiſsion, in not running after Chriſt when he ſayd, <hi>Come follow me,</hi> could neither be pleaſing vnto God, nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to himſelfe, nor gracious or
<pb facs="tcp:20958:36"/> acceptable in the iudgement of the world: and therefore extorted from our Lord and Sauiour, the ſeuere re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion which is leuied in my Text, with <hi>Quid ad te?</hi> why lendeſt thou mee thine eare, but followeſt not with thy feete?</p>
            <p>In the firſt part of this Text, which is the perſon of Chriſt Ieſus, reproouing the Apoſtle for his deſire of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, without a diligent care of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming due obedience, I haue ſpoken not long ſince, in that worthy audience of <hi>Poules,</hi> touching the two firſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues of our Sauiours taxing <hi>Peter;</hi> the one drawne from his owne diſlike of ſuch vnprofitable ſtudyes, &amp; the other from that ſlender crop, which it could affoord the Queſtioniſt himſelfe.</p>
            <p>There remaineth in that firſt part, the third and laſt inducement, which might vrge our Sauiour to this vnuſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſeueritie, namely, if there were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but the hatefull, loathed diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtfullnes, which it hath euen in mans
<pb facs="tcp:20958:36"/> corrupted ſinfull iudgement, it were able to make him which knew al ſinne, ſo vile, as that it had brought him to his ſhamefull bloudy croſſe, to ioyne with the world, in reproouing of this one ſinne, and to cry vnto Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> as he doth in this place. <hi>Quid id ad te?</hi> Fie <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> my Apoſtle? this knowledge with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out obedience, is not for thy profeſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>In opening which one cauſe of the opinion of the world, giue me leaue I beſeech you, with as much breuity as I can, to ſhew you what is her iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment concerning both thoſe ſinnes, which here are found and marked in our Apoſtle. For there are two ſinnes <note n="e" place="margin">Num. 15. 22. 24.</note> by <hi>Moſes</hi> poynted out in the Law, the one of Commiſsion, &amp; the other of Omiſsion, and they are both here per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petrated by Saint <hi>Peter</hi> in my Text, and both of them reprooued in the iudgement of the world. The firſt is his ſinne of Commiſsion, in thirſting vnſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiably after endleſſe knowledge, and
<pb facs="tcp:20958:37"/> this the world holds fruitleſſe, becauſe it laboureth for impoſsibilities: the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is his ſinne of Omiſsion, his neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of duetie, in not following Chriſt, when he ſaid <hi>Sequere;</hi> &amp; this men count odious, becauſe default was made in not doing that which was ſo nece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary. And verily, if the ſonnes of wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched <hi>Adam,</hi> do thus repute, &amp; cenſure Saint <hi>Peters</hi> action, to bee either alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether booteleſſe, or elſe ſo exceeding odious, the bleſſed ſonne of God Chriſt Ieſus our redeemer, muſt needs checke the ſame faults in his deere Apoſtle, with <hi>Quid ad te? Peter</hi> this is not for thee, I blame thy curioſitie.</p>
            <p>The former part of their ſentence, they firmely ground vpon the nature and condition of mans immortall ſoule, whoſe permanence being euerlaſting, her eſſence ſpirituall, and her appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions infinite, the world wel know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, cannot bee ſatisfied with that which is either of a limited continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, a groſſer ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, or of finite ſette

Wherefore God from heauen, ſeeing the rich man ſo greatly erre, as to thinke a diuine ſpirituall eſſence could feede ſo groſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as on terreſtriall creatures: that his corne in his garners, or coyne in his coffers, were victuals for her nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, told him that he was but <note n="m" place="margin">Luk. 12. 20.</note> a foole for his labor, for ſuch intellectuall and heauenly ſpirits, with earthly bodyes neuer can bee filled, it is no due foode, it is no competent ſuſtenance.</p>
            <p>And for the third and laſt, that an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite ſubſtance cannot be ſatisfied with finite co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plements, it is eaſily to be lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Geometricall proportions.</p>
            <p>For the rule is true in that excellent
<pb facs="tcp:20958:39"/> ſcience, that no circle drawne in the compaſſe of a triangle, can poſsibly fill vp all the corners of that figure, but though it be made with neuer ſo large a circumference, yet ſtill the angles will be vnrepleniſhed. Now humanitie hath taught vs, <note n="m" place="margin">Ariſtotel de genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malium. li. 2. cap. 4.</note> that the heart of man which is the ſoules ſeate, &amp; lifes bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warme fountaine, is <hi>triangularis fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurae,</hi> a ſubſtance with three corners: of which, two, and thoſe ſome what broa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d vpward in the body, as though nature taught her, that her affections ſhould bee ofter and greater vpward to heauen, and things heauenly, and the third, which is pendent, is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more ſharpe poynted, as though the faſhion of this lodge, ſhould teach her gueſt this leſſon, that her thoughts ſhould bee ſeldome and ſparing downeward.

            <p>Remember, O remember I moſt humbly intreate you, what Saint <hi>Iames</hi> that good Biſhop in old time did aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe vs: that <note n="ſ" place="margin">Iames 1. 27.</note> pure Religion and vndefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led before God, is what? to be humerous in maintayning ſtrange and vaine para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxes, to broche dayly to the world ſome new-found aſſertio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s? No, no ſuch matter: this is it which God our Father wel accepteth, if we viſite the fatherleſſe and widowes in their troubles, and if wee keepe our ſelues vnſpotted of the world.

               <hi>Sequere.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Forget not beloued brethren, you that are called to <hi>Peters</hi> function, the moſt honourable ſeruice vnder Kings &amp; Princes, forget not <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi>

               <hi>Nec edens venit nec bibens,</hi> he was one that liued well, his carriage was a patterne of all graue ſobrietie: O folow his ſteps, imitate <hi>Iohn Baptiſt,</hi> let not all bee queſtions, and nought in acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, all care of ſtudie, and none of pietie. This is it which our Sauiour by no meanes will approoue of.</p>
            <p>And for you the deere children of the Church our mother, may it pleaſe you at my inſtance, ſeariouſly to conſider, that it is indeede a high and excellent commendation for any one <note n="z" place="margin">Acts 11. 24.</note> with <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas</hi> amongſt the Iewes, to haue this giuen forth of him, O ſurely he is a good man: or <note n="a" place="margin">Acts 10. 2.</note> with <hi>Cornelius</hi> amongſt the Gentiles, to receiue this teſtimonie of

No, he muſt doe <note n="c" place="margin">Act. 10. 2</note> as he did, hee muſt pray oft to God, and giue much almes to the people: elſe all his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is nought without obedience.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>Vt of this ſhort Scripture (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued Chriſtians) conſiſting of foure parts, as a naturall body of foure principall Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, I haue heretofore in this and another Auditorie, intreated of the firſt: to witte, the agent which in this place keepes viſitations with <hi>S.

            <p>In vnfolding which reproofe from the Churches great Reformer, let mee
<pb facs="tcp:20958:48"/> firſt in all poſsible humilitie beſeech you, that no man miſconceiue or miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtrue theſe my ſpeeches, who ſtriue not to reſtraine the moſt painefull ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching after neceſſarie knowledge, but onely to repreſſe the tickling humor of fruitleſſe <hi>Curioſitie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I remember a ſtorie of the <note n="a" place="margin">Iudg. 20. 16</note> men of <hi>Beniamin,</hi> that the Scripture ſayth, they were excellent at the ſling, ſo as if they threw ſtones at any marke, they would not fayle to hit it within the breadth of a hayre: but yet as actiue and as nimble as they were, they were but left-han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded people, they threw not with the right. This brings to memorie a ſaying of King <hi>Salomons,</hi> who tells vs <note n="b" place="margin">Eccle. 10. 2.</note> that the heart of a wiſe man, is at his right hand, but (alas) the foole hath his placed on the left. Indeede not vnlike, it wanteth not probabilitie. For (God wot) there are many in this vild cenſorious world, which doe not <note n="c" place="margin">2 Kin. 4. 41</note> with <hi>Eliſha</hi> the man of God (in the Colledge of the Prophets which was at <hi>Gilgall</hi>) turne bitter <hi>Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quintida</hi>

But for the other rule, which gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the caueat againſt mans proud am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious curioſity, God wots many good men, many Chriſtians, yea, the Apoſtles themſelues haue beene taken tardie in liſtning to this precept, whilſt they haue runned with hotte foote after needleſſe knowledge: wherefore ſince Saint <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> in the narrow verge of this tent, was by our Sauiour (as his viſitour) founde culpable of this fault, I thought good the laſt ſaboth, in the ſecond part of this ſcripture (which is Chriſts action, his reproofe of curioſitie) to ſhew you the

The two firſt of theſe by the aeternall aſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and your gentle clemencie, I paſſed ouer the laſt day: which were the ſtocke ſhee came off, and her true deportments; now ſuffer mee I beſeech you, with your accuſtomed patience, to tender you that debte which then I left vnpayed, and (that I may recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence my laſt dayes tediouſneſſe with this howres ſhortneſſe) breefly to ſhew you thus much: that (if holy men and wiſe men in all times and ages, haue ſeuerely taxed this ſinne in whomſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer) it is no maruaile if hee which was the holyeſt of holyes and his fathers wiſedome, diſcouering the ſame weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in his deere Apoſtle, did labour to remooue it, with this ſharpe checke of <hi>Quid ad te?

            <pb facs="tcp:20958:78"/>
            <p>It is true which the man of GOD knowne by the name of <hi>Eloquente,</hi> and <note n="i" place="margin">Eſay 6. 7.</note> who had his lippes by a Seraphin, touched with a coale from the Altar, did ſay in reference of man to God, that <note n="k" place="margin">Eſay 55. 8. 9.</note> our wayes by no meanes may be reſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bled vnto his, nor are our thoughts to be compared with Gods: but, as the heauens are higher then the earth, ſo are his cogitations much more excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ours: wherefore if by their prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts and practize I ſhall make good, that both men prudent and religious, haue euermore diſliked this endleſſe curioſitie, and both by their councell and carriage, ſtudied and indeuored to draw men from it, it muſt needes ſtand agreeable with our Sauiours wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, (ſo <note n="l" place="margin">Math. 21. 16.</note> great as in babes mouthes it can ſilence all their learning) to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the ſame humour when he finds it in his Apoſtle, with <hi>Quid ad te?</hi> I like not this vaine knowledge, <hi>Peter</hi> aske no ſuch queſtions.</p>

            <p>And to leade you backward to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent ages, the ſcripture hath true te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies of this infirmitie, which may
<pb facs="tcp:20958:110"/> ſhew the contagion of this diſeaſe, not onely in the people, but in the Prophet alſo. For if yee looke into the monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the ſonnes of <hi>Iacob,</hi> you may remember in the publiſhing of the royall Lawe, that when God would meete <hi>Moſes</hi> in the mount of <hi>Sina,</hi> hee <note n="m" place="margin">Exo. 19. 12</note> commaunded the multitude ſhould not aſcend the hill, but that their liſts and bounders ſhould be ſette them by his ſeruant. Nay more then ſo, as hee ſayd by his Prophets, not onely <note n="n" place="margin">pſa. 105. 15.</note> doe them no harme, but touch not my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynted, ſo wonderfull preciſe was God in this behalfe, that the people were not onely interdicted to goe vp, <note n="o" place="margin">Exo. 19. 13.</note> but further they might not ſo much as touch the mountaine: and (alas) all this was but for feare of one thing, leſt they <note n="p" place="margin">Exo 19. 21.</note> ſhould gaze or ſtare on him that ſpake with <hi>Moſes.</hi> So proane is mans frayle and ſinfull nature, to be prying into Gods eternall eſſence, that to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine their buſie and lawleſſe Curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie, he was enforced firſt to giueforth
<pb facs="tcp:20958:111"/> his prohibition vnto Iſrael, &amp; (if words might not preuaile) to keep them forth with liſts: and if not theſe neither could be ſufficient, <note n="q" place="margin">Exo. 19. 13.</note> to terrifie them with feare and awe of death, that euerie of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender in breaking of the boundes, ſhould either bee ſtoned or ſtriken through with darts. Gods ſacred wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome foreſaw that appetite of looking into hidden things, and things forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, yea euen in Iſrael, that Kingly prieſthood, that choſen generation, the ſcepter of his inheritance. And no maruell if the multitude were guiltie of this crime, if the common people offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded in this treſpaſſe, for <hi>Moſes</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe was not cleere from this infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie.

               <hi>ſufficit mea gratia,</hi> my grace is ſufficient for them which may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it.

Thus Iewes, thus
<pb facs="tcp:20958:112"/> Gentiles, thus the people, yea, thus <hi>Moſes</hi> haue beene too audacious in inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to the Godhead.

            <p>Theſe things well learned by <hi>Peter</hi> a great Apoſtle, might well reſtrayne his thoughts from ſtudying, and his tongue from asking concerning the
<pb facs="tcp:20958:113"/> eſſence of the bleſſed Deity. But for the other two parcelles in the glorious God-head, namely his wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>drous works and his hidden ſecret will, I feare mee if we ſift this queſtion of Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> hee will bee ſo farre ſpotted with curious ſearching them, as that Chriſt muſt needes ſpunge him with thereproofe of my text, ſaying, <hi>Quid ad te?</hi> theſe are not for thy learning.</p>
            <p>In my former Sermons (right Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, right Worſhipfull, and wel-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued Chriſtians) I haue ſpoken of the two firſt parts in my texts diuiſion: to witte, in the firſt place of the agent in this Scripture, the viſitor which looks into Saint <hi>Peters</hi> treſpaſſe: of whome (being Chriſt Ieſus our Lord and Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,) I haue ſpoken in the two firſt Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, in this and another preſence. In the next place I haue intreated of the viſitours action, his calling <hi>Peter</hi> to the Court, or the reproofe of his Curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: and this through the aſsiſtance of Gods holy ſpirit, and your accuſtomed
<pb facs="tcp:20958:114"/> patience, I haue finiſhed in two other Sermons in this Chriſtian auditorie: I proceede now to the third part of this little text, <hi>ſubiectum in quo,</hi> the ſubiect matter in which Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſinned, or rather (if you wil) the articles obiected in his Maſters viſitation, for which by him he is ſo ſeuerely taxed. And theſe (as I hope your clemencie wel remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breth) were three in number: the firſt his Curioſitie, in reſpect of God, whilſt he would thruſt himſelfe into the fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of his ſecret myſteries, yet paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ouer ſuch knowledge as God hath well permitted: the ſecond, his buſie medling, to knowe the affayres of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, yet neglecting the duties which were inioyned himſelfe: the third and laſt, his too carefull labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in matters of ſmall weight, omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the meane ſeaſon more great important workes. Three ſhrewd of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, the leaſt of them worthie of an earneſt reprehenſion, from the great Arch-biſhoppe, the ſhepheard of his
<pb facs="tcp:20958:114"/> ſoule, as in each of them by order, I will breefely ſhew you, how they muſt needes extort from Chriſt this ſhort taxation of <hi>Quid ad te? Peter</hi> theſe leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are not for thy ſtudie.</p>
            <p>The firſt Article of our Sauiours re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe amongſt theſe three, is that part of Curioſitie which commonly is inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

               </gap> his bootleſſe waſtfull labour, in ranſacking the ſecrets of Gods hidden cloſet, in prying too nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly into his priuie chamber, in ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching too buſily into ſuch darke my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, as was his pleaſure to conceale from ſinfull man. In this part common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſonnes of <hi>Adam</hi> doe greeuouſly offend by three ſundry wayes: eyther by longing to finde forth Gods bleſſed eſſence, the ſubſtance of his nature: or els by intruding the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues into his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious but yet moſt wondrous works, or laſtly by ſearching into his hidden abſtruſe will, which it ſtands not with his liking to reueale to mortall men. From the firſt of which crimes, Saint
<pb facs="tcp:20958:115"/> 
               <hi>Peter</hi> muſt needs ſtand cleere and well acquitted, no exception lyeth againſt him for inquiring of Gods eſſence: but for the other branches, the diſcuſsing of Gods workes, and the ſifting of his will, may it pleaſe you but a little to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue with me the drift of <hi>Peters</hi> que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, which drew this anſwere from his Lord and Maſter, and you ſhall ſee how culpable hee is of both theſe treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes: ſo that in this firſt Article for both theſe foule defaults, our Sauiour muſt needs keepe his corrections with him, ſaying, <hi>Quid ad te?</hi> neither of theſe faults are beſeeming my Apoſtle.</p>
            <p>For the former, which is the diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of Gods wondrous workes, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member there haue beene ſuch in the dayes of old, as haue in this ſort beene maruailous inquiſitiue. both concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this worlds creation, and poore ſinfull mans moſt happie reſtitution.

            <p>And verily the ground work which our Sauiour wel might vſe, and which <hi>Peter</hi> in his owne knowledge could not but yeeld vnto, amongeſt great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietie of others moe, might worthily be ſetled on theſe foundations for the checking of Saint <hi>Peter</hi> in this too bold queſtion: that if this preſumtious Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſitie of the Apoſtles, in ſtudying to find forth Chriſts future purpoſes, did

            <p>For the firſt, the impoſsibility of this ſtudie in nature, it was perhaps with S. <hi>Peter,</hi> in this demaunde to his Maſter, as it was with <hi>Eſdras</hi> in his queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Angell <hi>Vriell,</hi> that euerye <note n="d" place="margin">2.
